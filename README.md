A simple rocket lander game with free fall under gravity using Pycharm.
Press SPACE BAR to use the fuel as decceleration. The goal of the game is to land the rocket under a set maximum speed to prevent it from crashing and land successfully. There is a set amount of fuel for the decceleration so make sure to make it count!
